    Member = 0.39
Non-Member = 0.52



Membership cost = 12.99

energy used (ROUND TRIP) = 0.8 kWh


I want to find out which is cheaper, ether geting the tesla super chargering subscription for $12.99 a month, or just paying without the subscription, I drive roughly  a total of 109.2 miles a month. The car can travel 5.28 miles per killawatt hour.



With the subscription:

	- Subscription cost: $12.99 per month
	- Price per kWh as a member: $0.39
	- Monthly kWh needed: 20.68 kWh
	- Monthly charging cost with subscription: 20.68 kWh × $0.39/kWh = $8.06
	- Total monthly cost with subscription: $12.99 + $8.06 = $21.05

Without the subscription:
	- Price per kWh as a non-member: $0.52
	- Monthly charging cost without subscription:  20.68 kWh × $0.52 / kWh = $10.76

So, the total monthly cost with the subscription is $21.05, whereas without the subscription, it's $10.76.

Thus, paying without the subscription is indeed cheaper for your usage.
